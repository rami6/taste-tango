This app helps you with cooking effortlessly without recipes.

1. Add seasonings, sauces, or whatever you have that adds taste to meals.
2. Hit the button.
3. Inspiration for quick cooking is generated. It's a combination of two to four items you've input.
4. If the combination looks good or interesting, you can use it for stir-fried meat/seafood/veggies, soup, or any cooking style you like.

This app has been deployed to https://taste-tango.vercel.app/. The input data is stored in the local storage of the browser so you don't have to type everything when you use the app again.


## The story behind the development

I never liked cooking. When I cooked, I would need recipes most of the time, which took me extra time and effort. However, recently I found myself cooking every day without hustle. Why is that? I looked for reasons.

- I'm not using recipes. Just combine whatever I have to add tastes.

Why is that?

- I have limited resources because I'm staying in temporary accommodation. There is a good chance of looking up recipes and finding out that I don't have necessary ingredients.

Looking back, I used to stock up on a variety of seasonings probably because the recipes I used made me buy and I hardly consumed the entire bottles as I didn't cook frequently. Of course, they eventually expired. Considering the situation I'm in, I realized that the easiest way of cooking is to know what you have and combine them. A potential downside is though, that you might end up rotating a few combinations and get sick of the tastes. That's when this app comes in handy.
